This is an Android VNC server using contemporary Android 5+ APIs. It therefore does not require root access. In reverence to the venerable <a href='https://github.com/oNaiPs/droidVncServer'>droid-VNC-server</a> is is called droidVNC-NG.

<h3>Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>Network export of device frame buffer.</li>
<li>Injection of remote pointer events.</li>
<li>Handling of special keys to trigger 'Recent Apps' overview, Home button and Back button.</li>
<li>Android permission handling.</li>
<li>Screen rotation handling.</li>
<li>File transfer via the local network, assuming TightVNC viewer for Windows version 1.3.x is used.</li>
<li>Password protection for secure-in-terms-of-VNC connection.</li>
<li>Ability to specify the port used.</li>
<li>Start of background service on device boot.</li>
<li>Reverse VNC.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes</h3>

Requires at least Android 7.

Since Android 10, the permission to access the screen contents has to be given on each start and is not saved. You can, however, work around this by installing adb (or simply Android Studio) on a PC, connecting the device running droidVNC-NG to that PC and running <code>adb shell cmd appops set net.christianbeier.droidvnc_ng PROJECT_MEDIA</code> allow once.
