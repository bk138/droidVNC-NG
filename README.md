This is an Android VNC server using contemporary Android 5+ APIs. It therefore does not require
root access. In reverence to the venerable [droid-VNC-server](https://github.com/oNaiPs/droidVncServer)
is is called droidVNC-NG.

## Features

* Network export of device frame buffer with optional server-side scaling.
* Injection of remote pointer events.

  work in a generic way due to [Android security restrictions](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/10/privacy/changes#clipboard-data).
* Handling of special keys to trigger 'Recent Apps' overview, Home button and Back button.
* Android permission handling.
* Screen rotation handling.
* File transfer via the local network, assuming TightVNC viewer for Windows version 1.3.x is used.
* Password protection for secure-in-terms-of-VNC connection.
* Ability to specify the port used.

## Notes

Requires at least Android 7.

[Since Android 10](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/10/privacy/changes#screen-contents),
the permission to access the screen contents has to be given on each start and is not saved. You can,
however, work around this by installing [adb](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb)
(or simply Android Studio) on a PC, connecting the device running droidVNC-NG to that PC and running
`adb shell cmd appops set net.christianbeier.droidvnc_ng PROJECT_MEDIA allow` once.

If you are using droidVNC-NG on [Android-x86](https://www.android-x86.org), it might be the case that
screen recording does not work at all and you only see a black screen in a connected VNC viewer.
